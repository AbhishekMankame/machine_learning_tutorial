## "What are neural networks?"
According to Wikipedia -- "A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in modern sense, an ANN composed of artificial neurons or nodes.

Neural networks generally consists of:
Input layer
Hidden layer
Output layer

## Neural network flow
Inputs --> Numerical Encoding --> Learns representation(patterns/features/weights) --> Representation outputs --> Outputs

Note: 
Neumerical Encoding --> before data gets used with a neural network, it needs to be turned into numbers.
Learns representation --> choose the appropriate neural network for your problem

## Types of learing:
Supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Transfer learning

## Deep Learning use cases
Recommendation
Translation
Computer Vision
Speech Recognition
Natural Language Processing(NLP)
